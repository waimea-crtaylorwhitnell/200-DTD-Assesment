## Design, Development and Testing Log

## 21/05/2024

Today I worked on the general flowchart of the website. I sent a screenshot of this version to Benjamin and asked if he was okay with the design.

The flowchart shows how users will "flow" through the website, this will show me how to program the website in a way that is intuitive and has no pages that the user might get stuck on.

## 23/05/2024

Today I updated the flowchart, as Ben thought that some part didn't quite make sense, specifically the "back" button.

All I did was remove the "back" button from the Login details page and changed the button from "back" to "cancel" on the New login details form page.
