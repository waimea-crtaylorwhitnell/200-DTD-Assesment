# Teacher Feedback on Documentation and Other Evidence

> Connor, you have made a reasonable start, but you really need to get a bit more done a quickly as possible - we're five weeks into this now. Initial sections should be complete, DB should be designed, should be well into the UI design, etc.

> Time to smash out this work so we can get to the coding ASAP


## System Requirements	

- [ ] **A** Purpose of outcome identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [ ] **A** End-users identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [ ] **A** Key functionality that satisfies the purpose and end-user requirements identified
- [ ] **A** Implications, relevant to purpose and end-users, are described and linked to design of outcome

> You need to add more details to the initial sections - please see the exemplars
> - Clear statement of the problem (saying why its a problem)
> - Clear description of typical end-users
> - Clear list of features

> Implications - all of them are started well, but...
> - Usability - need to refer to Nielsen's heuristics
> - All of them - need to say *what* you must do, and *how* you will achieve these things in your project - see the exemplar for an example


## Database Structure	

- [ ] **A** Structure of the database is designed (tables, fields, data types, primary keys, relationships, etc.)
- [ ] **M** Structure of the database is logical (i.e. DB is normalised, tables / fields are named logically, etc.)

> Where is this? Should be done


## Front-End UI Designs

- [ ] **A** Design for key web pages have been sketched out with supporting notes, etc.

> Started, but where are the UI layouts, etc.?


## System Testing

### Functionality Testing

- [ ] **A** Functionality has been tested and there is evidence for this (screenshots, etc.)
- [ ] **M** Testing is thorough (all functionality covered)

> Comments...  

### Code Testing

- [ ] **E** Code (HTML and CSS) validates. Documented evidence for this

> Comments...  


## Improvements Based on Testing

- [ ] **M** Info. from testing has been used to improve the outcome
    - [ ] End-user feedback has been used to improve the system

### Iterative Improvements

- [ ] **E** Evidence of a series of planned, iterative design-test-improve cycles (at least three) used to refine one or more aspects of outcome
    - [ ] Design of the UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented functionality has been iterated

> Comments...  


## Review and Evaluation

- [ ] **M** Discussion of how the relevant implications were addressed in the implementation of the outcome
