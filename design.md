# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **Password storage system**

Project Author: **Connor Taylor-Whitnell**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

People need a way to store and manage passwords.

### End-User Requirements

The website will be used by users such as old people, and forgetful people (Ben). The website will therefore need to have large text that is easy to read preferably with a colour that contrasts the rest of the website.

### Proposed Solution

The website will allow storage of login details, along with allowing the addition and deletion of said details

## Relevant Implications

## Relevant Implications

### Usability

The usability implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how easy it is to use for the end-user, without the need for help or guidance.

This website will need to be usable by old people or forgetful people (Ben), this means it must be simple, easy to understand, and use.

I will need to consider what devices people will use on this website and try to make it easy to use. This could mean font size and colour, contrast, and the buttons.

### Functionality

The functionality implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

The website must be functional for users, otherwise the website would be useless.

I will need to consider the database and how the system interacts with it.

### Aesthetics

The aesthetic implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how it looks in terms of design.

Most users will not use a website if it doesn't look up to their standards. Aesthetics can also help with usability.

The website should be pleasing to look at while still remaining easy to look at and figure out.

### End-Users

The end-user implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) are connected to the specific needs of the end-user(s).

Since the people using the website will all be from different backgrounds, tech experiences, and devices, the website must be simple yet intuitive.

To do this I must consider the simplicity and layout while also keeping the functionality, I must also make sure that the website works with most devices and the built-in functions of the browser (e.g. Chrome's translate website function)

### Intellectual Property

The intellectual property (IP) implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to not infringing on the IP of others, in terms of copyright, trade marks, patents, etc..

Since this is a website about sharing photos
