# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **Password storage system**

Project Author: **Connor Taylor-Whitnell**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

People who frequently use the internet tend to sign up to many different websites, and that can sometimes lead to some of the passwords being forgotten as more accounts are made. A system to help online users keep track of their login details would therefore be quite helpful.

### End-User Requirements

Those who roam the grand expanses of the internet tend to be of all ages, from young to old. This means that I must make the language used in the website easy to understand for anyone who wishes to use it. I will also need to use colours and fonts that are easy on the eyes, so that anyone in need of the website will be able to use it with little difficulty.The level of IT expertise for those using the website will vary from high to low, as most people use the internet and may find the website helpful. This means that I will need to make the website easy and intuitive to all. As this is a website for login details I won't need to go too over the top with the design and can probably make it quite simple.

### Proposed Solution

A website / app that allows a user to store their login details to any websites that they may use. User should be able to:
View a list of websites that they have details saved for. 
View a list of details for a specific website.
Add the details of a new website to the list.
Delete the details of a website that they may no longer use.
Additionally, the website should:
Be very simple to use.
Be accessible to all.
Be well designed and not be irritating to use.

## Relevant Implications

### Usability

The usability implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how easy it is to use for the end-user, without the need for help or guidance. I will need to keep in mind Neilsen's 10 usability heuristics, which include:
Letting users know the current system status.
Keeping the different pages of the website consistent.
Only showing information that is necessary as to not cause confusion.
Giving the user appropriate error messages to help them understand what the issue is.

I will need to design my system to be as usable as possible since the users of the system may come from all walks of life and will have a wide range of IT skills. I need to ensure that the system is usable for people, even if they aren’t skilled with IT.

As I design my website’s UI, I will refer to Nielsen’s heuristics and try to make sure that the UI meets them as far as possible. Specifically, I will aim for a very clean and modern interface (aesthetic and minimalist design) that sticks to modern UI conventions (consistency and standards). The UI should be very intuitive to use (recognition rather than recall). To verify this, I will test my UI with my users and obtain feedback which will allow me to refine my design.

### Functionality

The functionality implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

I will need to design my system to be as functional as possible as most people will not continue using a website that has slow load times and is full of glitches. I need to ensure that the website will run without any issues.

As I design my website, I will need to make sure that I do the proper error testing to ensure that the website doesn't have any glitches or bugs. This will include getting my client to go through and see if I have missed anything.

### Aesthetics

The aesthetic implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how it looks in terms of design.

I will need to design my system so that it is easy on the eyes to look at and fits the general theme of the website. I also need to make sure that the website isn't too messy, but still has everything that it needs to function.

As I design my website I will need to make sure that I use a colour scheme that fits my website. Which according to colour theory would be blue, due to the sense of security it brings. I will also make sure that all of the website's components are properly spaced out, to prevent it from looking messy.

### End-Users

The end-user implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) are connected to the specific needs of the end-user(s).

I will need to design my system so that it is easy to understand for anyone who may end up using it, keeping in mind that this will be quite a large age-range. I also need to make sure that the website actually meets the needs of the user by doing its intended function.

As I design my website I will need to make sure that I use terms that the "average person" would be able to understand so that there is no confusion when it comes to the navigation of the website. I will also make sure that the buttons do what they say that they will as to prevent any further confusion.

### Accessibility

The accessability implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how the website is accessible to those who have disabilities, impaired vision.

I will need to design my system so that it is accessible to anyone who may suffer from: dyslexia / impaired vision / colour blindness / autism / or any other disabilities. I will also need to ensure that the website is accessible on other devices to some degree, as there are many different devices that people may be accessing the website from.

As I design my website I will need to make sure that I use a larger font size so that anyone who may have dyslexia and / or impaired vision shouldn't have any issues when using it. I will also make it with a format that should work on most devices, due to the reasons stated in the paragraph above.

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.
